Before starting the stack, install required containers in docker from dockerhub:

$docker pull traefik
$docker pull mikesir87/cats

Delete and replace acme.json file with a new one with following code:

$sudo rm acme.json
$sudo touch acme.json
$sudo chmod 600 acme.json

Rename env.sample file as ".env" and replace the placeholder credentials with your own.

Replace the required information inside docker-compose.yml and traefik.toml files with your own domains, ports, emails etc.

Thank you!
