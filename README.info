This is a small project we did as an assigment at HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences

Made by Jere Eskelinen, Saana Korpinen and Oliver Parkkonen

Before starting the stack, install required containers in docker from dockerhub:

  $docker pull traefik
  $docker pull mikesir87/cats

Delete and replace acme.json file with a new one with following code:

  $sudo rm acme.json
  $sudo touch acme.json
  $sudo chmod 600 acme.json

Leave the file empty. Required data is auto-generated once you start the stack first time.

Rename env.sample file as ".env" and replace the placeholder credentials with your own.

Replace the required information inside docker-compose.yml and traefik.toml files with your own domains, ports, emails etc.

Start up the stack with:

  $sudo docker-compose up -d

To shutdown the stack:

  $sudo docker-compose down
